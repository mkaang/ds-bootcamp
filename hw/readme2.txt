Part 1 and Part 2 is available in the same script --youdo2.py--

model_part1_gd function applies batch gradient descent for Part 1
model_part2_gd is just L2 regularization added version of model_part1_gd

By running the script Part 1 RMSE score is printed first.
Then by using .2, .4, .6, .8 and 1.0 for lamda values in Part 2,
the best RMSE score in the test set is printed with the corresponding lambda value.
